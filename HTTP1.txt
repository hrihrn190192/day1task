HTTP/1.1 is a sequential protocol, so only one request can be sent at a time.
TTP/2 allows for asynchronous requests, multiple requests can be sent at the same time using a single connection.
HTTP/1.1 uses a text-based protocol.
HTTP/2 uses a binary protocol, where requests are sent in the form of 0s and 1s.
HTTP/2 is faster than HTTP/1.1. HTTP/2 can use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once. HTTP/2 also consumes less bandwidth, is more efficiently parsed, and is less error-prone than HTTP/1.1.
